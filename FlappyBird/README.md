# FlappyBird
- `FlappyBird` is a project for developing a simple flappy bird game without using a game engine.

## Support Platform
- Windows 10/11 Home/Pro

## Dependencies
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio 2019 or 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ko/)
- [CMake 3.27 or later](https://cmake.org/)
- [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)

## How to get repository clone?

You can obtain a copy of the repository using the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/ChoiJiOne/FlappyBird.git
```

## How to generate Visual Studio solution?

To generate and run a Visual Studio solution, execute either `GenerateProjectFiles_vs2019.bat` or `GenerateProjectFiles_vs2022.bat`.
To only generate or update the Visual Studio solution, run either `HotReload_vs2019.bat` or `HotReload_vs2022.bat`.

> Make sure to execute the script that matches the installed version of Visual Studio.

## How to build solution?

This project supports building without running Visual Studio. The build script supports the following build modes: `Debug`, `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, and `MinSizeRel`, each with the following characteristics.

| mode | description |
|:---:|:---|
| Debug | No optimization is performed during the build process, and a debug information file (.pdb) is generated. |
| Release | Optimization is performed during the build process, and no debug information file (.pdb) is generated. |
| RelWithDebInfo | Optimization is performed during the build process, and a debug information file (.pdb) is generated. |
| MinSizeRel | Optimization is performed during the build process, with a focus on minimizing size, and no debug information file (.pdb) is generated. |

Therefore, you can perform the build for each mode by executing the following batch script.
- `Debug`
  ```
  Build_Debug.bat
  ```
- `Release`
  ```
  Build_Release.bat
  ```
- `RelWithDebInfo`
  ```
  Build_RelWithDebInfo.bat
  ```
- `MinSizeRel`
  ```
  Build_MinSizeRel.bat
  ```

## How to package project?

This project supports generating an exe file that allows the project to be installed on the user's machine. To use this feature, NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) must be installed, and its installation path must be registered in the environment variables. The packaging script supports the same modes as the build modes: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Therefore, by running the following commands in CMD or PowerShell, you can obtain the package file for each mode.

> However, the solution must be built for this to work. Please refer to [this section](#how-to-build-solution) for the build process.

> You will not be able to use this feature if the NSIS path is not registered in the environment variables.

- `Debug`
  ```
  Package_Debug.bat
  ```
- `Release`
  ```
  Package_Release.bat
  ```
- `RelWithDebInfo`
  ```
  Package_RelWithDebInfo.bat
  ```
- `MinSizeRel`
  ```
  Package_MinSizeRel.bat
  ```
